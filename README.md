A Web-app which visualizes and traces the basic data structures and algorithms.

Its deployed live!

Some algorithms also have step by step and appropriate pointers.

The following are covered : 

Sorting Algorithms:

1) Selection Sort
2) Insertion Sort
3) Bubble Sort
4) Quick Sort
5) Merge Sort

Data Structures:

1) Stack
2) Queue
3) Linked List

Bonus:

1) Binary Tree
2) Graph(with BFS-DFS traversals)
3) Djikstra's algortihm
4) Binary Search

The code is not what you'd call "organized" .. but it works nonetheless!
