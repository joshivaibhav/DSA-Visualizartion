# DSA-Visualization
A Web-app which visualizes and traces the basic data structures and algorithms.

Its deployed live!

Check it out here : http://just2test.in/jay/algo/



Some algorithms also have step by step and appropriate pointers.

The following are covered : 

Sorting Algorithms:

1) Selection Sort
2) Insertion Sort
3) Bubble Sort
4) Quick Sort
5) Merge Sort

Data Structures:

1) Stack
2) Queue
3) Linked List

Bonus:

1) Binary Tree
3) Djikstra's algortihm 
4) Binary Search

NOTE : In Djikstra's Algorith, when the dialog box on then top right reads "Enter distance" then just enter the distance between the nodes  and hit enter

The code is not what you'd call "organized" .. but it works nonetheless!
